It is also the duty of the State to establish and implement the border policy and to promote integration, in particular of Latin America, as well as the development and cohesiveness of border zones, in accordance with the foreign policy. Article 45 The power of the State emanates from the people. Those who exercise it do so within the limitations and under the responsibilities set forth by the Constitution and the law. No individual, organization, branch of the Armed Forces, National Police force, or group of people may arrogate to themselves the exercise of such power. To do so constitutes rebellion or sedition. Article 46 No one owes obedience to a usurper government or to anyone who assumes public office in violation of the Constitution and the law. The civil population has the right to insurrection in defense of the constitutional order. Acts of those who usurp public office are null and void.

In the case of treaties subject to approval by Congress, such denunciation requires its previous approval. TITLE III. THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM CHAPTER I. GENERAL PRINCIPLES Article 58 Private initiative is free. It is exercised within a social market economy. Under this system, the State guides the development of the country and it is principally active in promoting employment, health, education, security, public services, and infrastructure. Article 59 The State promotes the creation of wealth and guarantees the freedom to work, as well as free enterprise, trade, and industry. The exercise of these freedoms must not be harmful to the public morals, health, or safety. The State provides opportunities to those sectors suffering from unequal opportunity for advancement. In this spirit, it promotes small businesses of all types. Article 60 The State recognizes economic pluralism. The national economy is sustained in the coexistence of diverse forms of ownership and enterprise.

Article 62 The freedom of contract guarantees that parties may validly negotiate, according to the rules in effect at the time of the contract. Contractual terms may not be modified by laws or any other provision whatsoever. Conflicts deriving from contractual relations may be resolved solely through arbitration or judicial recourse, in accordance with the protective mechanisms provided for in the contract, or established by law. By means of contract law, the State may provide guarantees and grant security. These may not be modified legislatively, without prejudice to the protection provided in the preceding paragraph.

Article 65 The State defends the interests of consumers and clients. For this purpose, it guarantees the right to information on goods and services available to them on the market. Likewise, it especially watches over the health and security of the population. CHAPTER II. THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE NATIONAL RESOURCES Article 66 Natural resources, renewable and non-renewable, are patrimony of the Nation. The State is sovereign in their utilization. An organic law fixes the conditions of their use and grants them to private individuals. Such a concession grants the title holders a real right subject to those legal regulations.

No one shall be deprived of his property, except, exclusively, on grounds of national security or public need determined by law, and upon cash payment of the appraised value, which must include compensation for potential damages. Proceedings may be instituted before the Judiciary to challenge the property value established by the State in the expropriatory procedure. Article 71 With respect to property, foreign nationals, whether they are persons or corporate entities, fall under the same conditions as Peruvians. Therefore, they may in no instance invoke exception or diplomatic protection. However, within a distance of fifty kilometers from the borders, foreigners may not acquire or possess under any title, directly or indirectly, mines, lands, woods, water, fuel, or energy sources, whether individually or in partnership, under penalty of losing that so acquired right to the State. The sole exception involves cases of public need expressly determined by executive decree and approved by the Cabinet, in accordance with the law.

Article 73 Public property is inalienable and may not be prescribed. Property available for public use may be granted to private parties, in accordance with the law, for its economic development. CHAPTER IV. TAX AND BUDGET REGIME Article 74 Taxes are created, modified, or abolished. Exemptions are granted exclusively by law or by legislative decree in case of delegation of powers, except for tariffs and rates, which are regulated by an executive decree.

The law sets forth the procedures, exceptions and respective responsibilities. Article 77 The economic and financial administration of the State is governed by the budget passed annually by Congress. The budget structure of the public sector consists of two parts: the central government and decentralized agencies. The budget allocates public resources fairly. Its programming and implementation depend on efficiency criteria that concern basic social necessities and decentralization. In accordance with the law, every circumscription shall receive an adequate share of the total income and revenue collected by the State for the utilization of natural recourses in each zone as a natural resource royalty (canon). Article 78 The President of the Republic sends the Budget bill to the Congress each year with a deadline expiring on August 30th. On the same date, he also sends the national debt and financial stability bills. The Budget bill shall be effectively balanced. Loans from the Central Reserve Bank of Peru or the Bank of the Nation are not considered fiscal revenue. Loans shall not cover current expenditures. The Budget shall not be passed without an appropriation for the servicing of public debt. Article 79 Members of Congress have no initiative for creating or increasing public spending, except on matters of their budget. The Congress may not pass taxes for predetermined purposes, except upon request of the Executive Branch. In any other case, tax laws concerning benefits or exemptions require a previous report of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Only by express law, passed by two-thirds of congressmen, may a special tax treatment for a specific zone of the country be selectively and temporarily extended. Article 80 The Minister of Economy and Finance sustains the income statement before the Plenary Assembly of Congress. Each minister maintains the expenditure statement of his own sector; prior to that, they shall sustain the outcomes and goals of the previous year budget execution, and the budget implementation progress of the current fiscal year. Likewise, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Prosecutor General of the Nation, and the President of the National Election Board sustain the statements of their own institutions. If the enrolled Budget bill is not referred to the Executive Branch by November 30th, the Executive original draft bill comes into effect and is enacted by legislative decree. The supplemental credits, additional expenditure and transfers of items are handled before Congress in the same manner as the Budget Act. During the congressional recess, they are handled in the Permanent Assembly. To pass, the votes of three-fifths of the legal number of its members are required. Article 81 The General Account of the Republic, accompanied by the audit report of the Office of the Comptroller General, is submitted by the President of the Republic to the Congress by August 15th of the year following the implementation of the budget. The General Account is examined and reported upon by a review committee by October 15th. Congress shall vote on its passage at the latest on October 30th. If the Congress fails to vote within this period, the review committee shall submit its opinion to the Executive Branch so that it may enact a legislative decree that includes the General Account. Article 82 The Office of the Comptroller General is a decentralized body of public law that enjoys autonomy in accordance with its organic act. It is the highest body of the National Control System. It is responsible for overseeing the respective legalities of the implementation of the national Budget, public debt operations, and activities of institutions subject to its control. The Congress appoints the Comptroller General for seven years upon recommendation from the Executive Branch. He may be removed by Congress for gross misconduct. CHAPTER V.

Its aim is to preserve monetary stability. Its functions are: to regulate the currency and credit of the financial system, to manage the international reserve under its responsibility, and to perform other functions as provided in its organic act. The Bank accurately and periodically informs the country about the state of the national finances under the responsibility of its Board of Directors. The Bank may not grant financing to public funds, except for the purchase on the secondary market of securities issued by the Treasury within the limits set forth by its organic act. Article 85 The Bank may conduct credit operations and formalize agreements, in order to cover temporary imbalances in its international reserves. A legal authorization is required, when the amount of such operations or agreements exceeds the limit as set forth in the Budget of the public sector, which must be reported to Congress. Article 86 The Bank is managed by a board of directors consisting of seven members. The Executive Branch shall appoint four members, including the President, who must be ratified by the Congress. Likewise, Congress votes the other three members through an absolute majority of the legal number of its members. All directors of the Bank are appointed for the same constitutional term as the President of the Republic. They do not represent any particular entity or interest. Congress may remove them for gross misconduct. In the event of such removal, the new directors hold office for the remaining constitutional term. Article 87 The State encourages and guarantees savings. The law establishes the obligations and limits of enterprises that collect savings from the public, as well as the mode and extent of such guarantees. The Superintendence of Banking, Insurance, and Private Pension Fund Management Firms is responsible for control over banking, insurance, and private pension fund management firms, other companies collecting deposits from the public, and those that conduct related and similar operations, as set forth in law. The law establishes the organization and functional autonomy of the Superintendence of Banking, Insurance, and Private Pension Fund Management Firms. The Executive Branch appoints the Superintendent of Banking, Insurance, and Private Pension Fund Management Firms for the period corresponding to its constitutional term of office. The Congress ratifies him. CHAPTER VI. THE AGRICULTURAL REGIME AND RURAL AND NATIVE COMMUNITIES Article 88 The State preferentially supports agricultural development and guarantees the right to ownership of the land, whether private, communal, or in any other form of partnership. The law may define boundaries and land area based on the features of each zone. According to legal provision, abandoned land reverts to State ownership, to be placed on the market. Article 89 The rural and native communities have legal existence and are corporate entities. They are autonomous in their organization, community work, and the use and free disposal of their lands, as well as in the economic and administrative aspects within the framework provided by law. The ownership of their lands may not prescribe, except in the case of abandonment described in the preceding article. The State respects the cultural identity of the rural and native communities.

They are not responsible to any authority or jurisdictional body for votes cast or opinions expressed in the exercise of their functions. The magistrates of the Constitutional Court and the Ombudsman enjoy the same prerogatives as the congressmen. The prosecution for the commission of common crimes charged to congressmen of the Republic during the exercise of their mandate is the competence of the Supreme Court of Justice. In case of commission of crimes before assuming the mandate, the ordinary criminal judge is competent. Article 94 Congress drafts and passes its own Standing Rules, which have the force of law. It also elects members to serve on the Permanent Assembly and committees, defines the organization and functions of parliamentary groups, manages its finances, approves its budget, appoints and removes its officers and employees, and grants them benefits in accordance with the law.

Article 97 Congress may initiate investigations on any matter of public interest. Upon request, appearances before the committees responsible for such investigations are compulsory, under the same requirements as judicial proceedings. In order to accomplish their purposes, such committees may have access to any information, which may entail lifting bank secrecy and the confidentiality of tax filings; except for information affecting personal privacy. The conclusions of the committees are not binding to jurisdictional bodies. Article 98 The President of the Republic is obliged to place at the disposal of the Congress those members of the Armed Forces and the National Police requested by the President of Congress. The Armed Forces and the National Police shall not enter the premises of Congress without authorization from its President.

DECENTRALIZATION Article 188 Decentralization is a form of democratic organization and a mandatory, continued policy of the State, whose essential purpose is the comprehensive development of the country. The decentralization process is carried out in stages, in a progressive and orderly manner, following criteria that permit the proper distribution of jurisdictions and transfer of resources from the national government to local and regional governments. The branches of government and autonomous state bodies, as well as the Budget of the Republic, are decentralized in accordance with the law. Article 189 The territory of the Republic is divided into regions, departments, provinces, and districts, in whose boundaries a government is exercised and organized at national, regional, and local levels in the terms defined by the Constitution and the law, preserving the integrity and unity of the State and the Nation. The regional level of government consists of regions and departments. The local level of government consists of provinces, districts, and villages. Article 190 Regions are created on the basis of contiguous areas with historical, cultural, administrative, and economic relations, thus comprising sustainable geo-economic unities. The regionalization process shall begin by electing governments in the current departments and the Constitutional Province of Callao. These are regional governments. Two or more contiguous departments may become a region by conducting a referendum, in accordance with the law. Likewise, two or more contiguous provinces and districts may change their regional constituency by following the same procedure. Additional authorities and faculties, as well as special incentives, given to these newly formed regions shall be determined by law. While the integration process is underway, two or more regional governments may create coordination mechanisms between themselves. The relevant law will regulate these mechanisms. Article 191 Regional governments enjoy political, economic, and administrative autonomy on pertinent matters within their jurisdiction. They coordinate with municipalities without interfering with their functions and authorities. The basic organic structure of these governments consists of the Regional Council as the regulatory and oversight body, the Regional Governor as the executive organ, and the Regional Coordination Council formed of provincial mayors and representatives of civil society as a consultative body to coordinate with municipalities, with their functions and authorities set forth in the law. The Regional Council shall have a minimum of seven (7) members and a maximum of twenty-five (25), with at least one (1) for each province, and the rest, in accordance with the law, determined by a criterion of electoral population. The Regional Governor is jointly elected with a Regional Vice Governor, by direct suffrage for a period of four (4) years. The mandate of these authorities is revocable, according to law. There is no immediate re-election. After another period, as a minimum, former Regional Governors or Regional Vice Governors can run for office again, subject to the same conditions. The members of the Regional Councils are elected in the same way and for the same time-period.

In order to run for the office of President of the Republic, Vice President, member of Congress, or Mayor; the Regional Governors and Vice Governors must resign their office six (6) months in advance of the respective election. The law determines the minimum percentages to facilitate representation of women, rural and indigenous communities, and aboriginal peoples in regional councils.

Resources allotted from the Regional Compensation Fund with a redistributive character, according to law. Resources resulting from natural resource royalties (canon).

Article 194 Provincial and district municipalities are bodies of local government. They enjoy political, economic, and administrative autonomy on the matters within their jurisdiction. Municipalities of villages are created pursuant to law. The organic structure of local governments consists of the Municipal Council as the regulatory and oversight body and the Office of the Mayor as the executive organ, with their functions and powers as provided by law. Mayors and council members are elected by direct suffrage for a period of four (4) years. There is no immediate reelection for mayors. After another period, as a minimum, they can run for office again, subject to the same conditions. Their mandate is revocable, according to law.

It enjoys special treatment in decentralization laws and in the Municipalities Act. The Metropolitan Municipality of Lima exerts jurisdiction within the territory of the province of Lima. Likewise, municipalities located on border zones receive special treatment in the Municipalities Act. Article 199 Local and regional governments are controlled by their own oversight bodies and by those other bodies set forth in the Constitution or any other statute. They are subject to control and supervision by the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic, which executes a decentralized and continued oversight system. Such governments formulate their budgets with citizen participation, and are accountable for their annual execution, in accordance with the law. TITLE V.
